# TeensyGamepad
An arcade-style gamepad system based on Teensy 2.0.

## Purpose
This project lets a Teensy microcontroller send keyboard events to a PC, based on input from arcade controller components.

## Build instructions
The code can be compiled and uploaded to the Teensy 2.0 board through [Teensyduino](http://pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html).

* Select the correct board model (Teensy 2.0 or Teensy++ 2.0) in the Arduino IDE under Tools -> Board.
* Set the correct USB type (Serial + Keyboard + Mouse + Joystick) under Tools -> USB Type.
